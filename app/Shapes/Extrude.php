// Create an Extrude class in the App\Shapes namespace. On construction it should take a class that implements ShapeInterface as well as a depth. It should have a volume() method which returns the volume (area Ã— depth) of the given shape. Make sure you use type-hinting to make sure you can't pass non-shapes into Extrude.
